### Overview

The goal of the project was to build the RESTO application of our choice with a back-end Ruby on Rails and a AngularJS frontend.

### Technologies

Ruby on Rails Angle JS HTML5 Heroku git Facebook 

### Development
The development of this latest project has been really exciting and challenging.
Inevitably having to set up the back end with Ruby and setting up the various reports has caused me a few problems but after a couple of attempts I managed to connect them correctly.

## Challenge
Definitely having to handle for the first time two different front-end languages ​​and another for the back-end was really complicated especially during the back-end creation, since Ruby is a great tool but you must know how to use it well.
As far as front-end development is concerned, it has been simpler intuitive by comparing the previous exercises in the classroom.

## Future additions
I'd like to add a map to show some racing locations or major events, and to succeed (do not know how) to have a sort of streaming channel where dronical fans can see some races or even how one of them is created .
